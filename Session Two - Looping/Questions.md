# Technical Questions - Week Two

This weeks questions are designed to help you learn how to interigate a question and learn how to extrapolate the information you need before you can begin. As a result of this some of the questions may feel bare but ***ASK AS MANY QUESTIONS AS YOU NEED TO, SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION FULLY BEFORE BEGINNING!*** (Help will be awkwardly waiting in the corner, just wave)

## Staircase
Given a number ```N``` print a ***staircase*** out of ```#'s```, the height and base should equal ```N```. For example;

```

NOTE : This isnt what we expect as output
```

Other cases

1 ) Array: ```[1,2,4,4]``` sum:```8``` --> ```TRUE```  

2 ) Array: ```[1,2,4,9]``` sum:```8``` --> ```FALSE```
