# QCS Technical Skills Challenge

If you would like to download this but don't want to learn how to use git, you can click the green "Clone/Download" button above then download a zip file. I'd recommend learning how to use git though!

How to use this with git:
- Go to https://git-scm.com/ and download it for your system. At this point you can either use the terminal or git's GUI which comes with it (accessed by typing `git GUI` into the terminal or finding the program on your system). These instructions will be for the terminal but you'll be able to find equivalent options in the gui.
- Go to the folder you want to install it to and copy the path. Open a terminal (cmd or powershell on windows, terminal on Mac or Linux) and enter the command:
`cd \path\to\your\folder`
(cd stands for change directory. This will open the terminal in that folder.)
(on windows you can ctrl+right click in your desired folder to directly open a terminal there)

- Click the "Clone or Download" button above and copy the url inside. Go back to your terminal and type 
`git clone https://github.com/QCSQUB/qcs-technical-challenge.git`
This will download everything here into that folder. Each week we'll upload the new files here, so you can just go to the directory in the terminal and use the command
`git pull`
to pull all those updates down to your system.

 If you work on a solution and are happy for us to include it as an exemplar solution, create a pull request (by forking this repository, pushing your changes there, then clicking the pull request button up above) or send it to us on Facebook. Best of luck!
