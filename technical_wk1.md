## Reverse a string
Given a string, reverse it by character. For example, if you are given the string ```abc``` the method should return ```cba```.

Other cases
 
1 )  ```my name is john``` --> ```nhoj si eman ym```

2 )  ```brian is bae``` --> ```eab si nairb```

3 )  ```comp sci``` --> ```ics pmoc```

## Reverse a sentence
Given a string, reverse the string by word order. For example, if you are given the string ```Hello world``` the method should return ```world Hello```

Other cases

1 ) ```my name is jim``` --> ```jim is name my```

2 ) ```Algorithms are fun``` --> ```fun are Algorithms```

3 ) ```This is a string``` --> ```string a is This```

## Find the smallest value in an array
Given an array of numbers identify the smallest element within the array,. For example, given the array ```[8,4,9,1,2,5]```, this method should return ```1```.

Other cases

1 ) ```[5,6,7,2,7,6,5]``` --> ```2```

2 ) ```[0,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]``` --> ```0```

## Find the largest value in an array
Given an array identify the largest element within the array. For example, given the array ```[8,4,9,1,2,5]```, this method should return ```9```.

Other cases

1 ) ```[5,6,7,2,7,6,5]``` --> ```7```

2 ) ```[0,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]``` --> ```9```

## Return all non-repeating values from a list with duplicates
Given an array identify non-repeating elements and return them. For example, given the array ```[6,6,1,8,8,9,9,9,2]```, this method should return ```[1,2]```.

Other cases

1 ) ```[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]``` --> ```[]```

2 ) ```[2,2,3,6,6,7]``` --> ```[3,7]```

3 ) ```[6,6,6,8,3,3,2,0,0]``` --> ```[8,2]```

## isAPalindrome()
Given a string identify if it is a palindrome. (A palindrome is a string which reads the same forwards and backwards). For example, if the method is given ```hannah``` it should return ```true```.

Other cases

1 ) ```"john"``` --> ```false```

2 ) ```"racecar"``` --> ```true```

1 ) ```"wow"``` --> ```true```
